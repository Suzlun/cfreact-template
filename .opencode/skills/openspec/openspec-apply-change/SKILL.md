Implement tasks from an OpenSpec change.

Before implementation, require a current `APPROVED` result from `openspec/proposer` or `openspec/analyzer` for the same Change and current artifact contents. This skill does not perform or load a semantic review workflow. If approval evidence is missing or stale, return `ANALYZER_REVIEW_REQUIRED` instead of reviewing the Change.

A Change contains repository-scoped work only. Never execute dependency or version additions, permission-boundary changes, destructive operations, release execution, deployment, environment provisioning, credential access or probes, external approval, staging or production validation, operational rehearsal, production observation, or another external side effect. Stop the affected work and report the exact operation and evidence.

Read the confirmed `intent.md` from `contextFiles` before implementation. Preserve its owner-approved outcome and classifications; do not replace it with a familiar solution pattern or a solution-shaped paraphrase.

When UI is in scope, treat `.wireframe.json` as the visible-surface source and the matching `.wireframe.html` and screenshot as `openspec/designer` rendering evidence. Never edit or recapture the evidence during apply. Resolve only self-evident implementation details that preserve existing actions, information structure, and copy. Return `BLOCKED` instead of redesigning the surface when artifacts conflict or a non-self-evident visible change is necessary.

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name. If omitted, check if it can be inferred from conversation context. If vague or ambiguous you MUST prompt for available changes.

**Steps**

1. **Select the change**

   If a name is provided, use it. Otherwise:
   - Infer from conversation context if the user mentioned a change
   - Auto-select if only one active change exists
   - If ambiguous, run `pnpm exec openspec list --json` to get available changes and use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to let the user select

   Always announce: "Using change: <name>" and how to override (e.g., `/opsx-apply <other>`).

2. **Check status to understand the schema**

   ```bash
   pnpm exec openspec status --change "<name>" --json
   ```

   Parse the JSON to understand:
   - `schemaName`: The workflow being used (e.g., "spec-driven")
   - `planningHome`, `changeRoot`, and `actionContext`: planning scope and edit constraints
   - Which artifact contains the tasks (typically "tasks" for spec-driven, check status for others)

3. **Get apply instructions**

   ```bash
   pnpm exec openspec instructions apply --change "<name>" --json
   ```

   This returns:
   - `contextFiles`: artifact ID -> array of concrete file paths (varies by schema - could be intent/proposal/specs/design/tasks or spec/tests/implementation/docs)
   - Progress (total, complete, remaining)
   - Task list with status
   - Dynamic instruction based on current state

   **Handle states:**
   - If `state: "blocked"` (missing artifacts): return `BLOCKED` with the missing-artifact evidence and stop without delegating artifact creation or repair
   - If `state: "all_done"`: skip implementation delegation and proceed to final build review
   - Otherwise: proceed to implementation

   **Workspace guard:** If status JSON reports `actionContext.mode: "workspace-planning"` and `allowedEditRoots` is empty, explain that full workspace apply is not supported in this slice. Treat linked repos and folders as read-only context, ask the user to select an affected area through an explicit implementation workflow, and STOP before editing files.

4. **Read context files**

   Read every file path listed under `contextFiles` from the apply instructions output.
   The files depend on the schema being used:
   - **new-feature**: intent, proposal, specs, design, tasks
   - **spec-driven**: proposal, specs, design, tasks
   - Other schemas: follow the contextFiles from CLI output

   If a required artifact is missing or a `contextFiles` path is unreadable, return `BLOCKED` with exact path evidence. Do not ask a planner or implementation agent to create or repair planning artifacts.

5. **Verify approval handoff**

   Verify that the caller supplied a current `APPROVED` result for this Change and that no artifact changed after that review. If the evidence is absent, stale, or for another Change, return `ANALYZER_REVIEW_REQUIRED`. Do not rerun semantic review.

6. **Show current progress**

   Display:
   - Schema being used
   - Progress: "N/M tasks complete"
   - Remaining tasks overview
   - Dynamic instruction from CLI

7. **Delegate tasks (loop until done or blocked)**

   At each iteration:
   - Determine each pending task's execution owner and split it only when needed for safe execution
   - Compute dependencies, shared-file or generated-artifact conflicts, and the dependency-safe parallel ready set
   - Delegate frontend work to `unit/frontend/engineer`, backend work to `unit/backend/engineer`, and other repository work to `unit/build/builder`
   - Launch independent ready work in parallel and record the concrete dependency or conflict when serialization is required
   - Accept current frontend and backend reviewer approval evidence, requesting the corresponding reviewer when evidence is missing, stale, or invalidated
   - Mark a task complete in the tasks file only after accepting implementation, verification, and required reviewer evidence: `- [ ]` → `- [x]`
   - Re-read apply instructions after each accepted batch and continue until `all_done`

   **Pause if:**
   - A dependency or version addition, permission-boundary change, destructive operation, or external operation is required → stop the affected task and report evidence
   - A required artifact is missing or unreadable → stop without delegating artifact repair
   - Implementation reveals a material unresolved product, contract, architecture, security, data, dependency, or visible-surface decision → return evidence to Proposer for the affected task
   - Error or blocker encountered → report the evidence
   - User interrupts

   Continue independent approved tasks that cannot be affected by a stopped task or material unresolved decision. Do not report the Change complete while any task remains blocked.

8. **Run final review and show status**

   When apply instructions report `all_done`, request final review from `unit/build/reviewer`. Route correctable implementation findings to the responsible implementer and repeat affected unit review. Report archive-ready only after final approval.

   Display:
   - Tasks completed this session
   - Overall progress: "N/M tasks complete"
   - If all done: suggest archive
   - If paused: explain why and wait for guidance

**Output During Implementation**

```
## Implementing: <change-name> (schema: <schema-name>)

Working on task 3/7: <task description>
[...implementation happening...]
✓ Task complete

Working on task 4/7: <task description>
[...implementation happening...]
✓ Task complete
```

**Output On Completion**

```
## Implementation Complete

**Change:** <change-name>
**Schema:** <schema-name>
**Progress:** 7/7 tasks complete ✓

### Completed This Session
- [x] Task 1
- [x] Task 2
...

Final build review approved. This change is archive-ready.
```

**Output On Pause (Issue Encountered)**

```
## Implementation Paused

**Change:** <change-name>
**Schema:** <schema-name>
**Progress:** 4/7 tasks complete

### Issue Encountered
<description of the issue>

**Options:**
1. <option 1>
2. <option 2>
3. Other approach

**Guardrails**

- Keep going through tasks until done or blocked
- Always read context files before starting (from the apply instructions output)
- Do not perform or load a semantic review workflow
- Require current approval evidence; otherwise request Analyzer review instead of self-review
- Compute ownership, splitting, dependencies, conflicts, and parallel groups at execution time
- Continue unaffected independent tasks when one task is stopped
- Update task checkbox immediately after completing each task
- Pause affected work on errors, safety boundaries, or material unresolved decisions; do not guess
- Use contextFiles from CLI output, don't assume specific file names

**Fluid Workflow Integration**

This skill supports the "actions on a change" model:

- **Can be invoked anytime**: Before all artifacts are done (if tasks exist), after partial implementation, interleaved with other actions
- **Allows artifact updates**: If implementation reveals design issues, suggest updating artifacts - not phase-locked, work fluidly
